<body>
<p>
A package of classes that provide an implementation of javax.servlet.Filter
that utilizes CAS authentication.  A web application that uses the
CAS client package can utilize a deployment descriptor (web.xml) that
includes &lt;filter&gt; and &lt;filter-mapping&gt; elements that refer
to the filter elements in this package.  By doing so, the application can
utilize CAS authentication to protect its Servlet resources.
