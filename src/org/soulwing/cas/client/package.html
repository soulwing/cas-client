The CAS client API.
</p>
<p>
This package provides the classes needed to use all of the authentication 
services of a CAS server.  Clients of this package should generally utilize
the Validator interface for interaction with the CAS server.  Clients
should obtain a instance of Validator using the ValidatorFactory object.

The ValidatorFactory requires an instance of RequestGenerator that will
be injected into Validator instances created by it.  The default
implementation of RequestGenerator is RequestGeneratorImpl.  This
implementation must be configured with the base URL for the CAS service
on the target CAS server.  The default implementation provides a few 
optional properties to support other facets of the CAS service.
